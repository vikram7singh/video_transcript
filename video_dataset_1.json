[{"question": "What is the purpose of the 'right ahead logging mode' in SQLite?", "expected_output": "The 'right ahead logging mode' in SQLite allows for multiple readers and one writer at a time, enabling writing while others are reading, thus preventing service lockup."}, {"question": "How does the 'save point' feature in SQLite help in managing transactions?", "expected_output": "The 'save point' feature in SQLite allows for creating nested transactions, where you can start transactions inside other transactions and roll them back independently if needed."}, {"question": "What is the advantage of using SQLite's 'right ahead logging mode' in cloud programming?", "expected_output": "The advantage of using SQLite's 'right ahead logging mode' in cloud programming is that it allows for one writer and multiple readers simultaneously, preventing service lockup and enabling efficient writing and reading operations."}, {"question": "How does the 'session extension' in SQLite facilitate cloud syncing and backup processes?", "expected_output": "The 'session extension' in SQLite allows for creating change sets that capture the differences in the database, which can be stored, applied to other copies of the database, and used for syncing and backup processes in cloud environments."}, {"question": "What is the key advantage of using one process programming for server development according to the speaker?", "expected_output": "The key advantage of using one process programming for server development is that it allows the programmer to keep the entire system in their mind, enabling quick development, easy monitoring, and simplified operations."}, {"question": "How does the speaker recommend handling the limitations of one process programming for server development?", "expected_output": "The speaker recommends being cautious about the limitations of one process programming, such as scaling constraints and latency issues, and suggests considering distributed systems for specific use cases that require more resources and global reach."}, {"question": "What is the main benefit of using SQLite in the speaker's server development approach?", "expected_output": "The main benefit of using SQLite in the speaker's server development approach is the operational simplicity and consistency it provides, as the server setup mirrors the client software, making monitoring, troubleshooting, and operations easier."}, {"question": "How does the speaker address the issue of data loss in cloud storage systems like Amazon's NAS?", "expected_output": "The speaker manually flushes the well log of SQLite and triggers a snapshot to blob storage system backup using a package called 'really fsync' to mitigate the risk of data loss in cloud storage systems like Amazon's NAS."}, {"question": "What is the speaker's opinion on SLAs and highly redundant cloud systems?", "expected_output": "The speaker advises caution regarding SLAs and highly redundant cloud systems, highlighting the asymmetry in SLAs and the potential risks of relying too heavily on ultra-redundant systems that may not be as fail-safe as claimed."}, {"question": "How does the speaker suggest handling cloud confidence and geo-sharing in server development?", "expected_output": "The speaker suggests considering geo-sharing to move customer data closer to them if feasible and emphasizes the importance of not overly relying on cloud confidence features that may not be necessary for moderately large services built using a one-process programming approach."}]
